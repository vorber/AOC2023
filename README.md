# AOC2023
My code for y2023 [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com).

This year I'm focusing on a few things

- Getting some experience coding in F# (Contrary to some legends I have almost no experience in it)
- Setting up my alternative development environment (I'm getting tired of being annoyed by VS and VSCode) - using NeoVim this time and tweaking configs/plugins/mappings as I go.
- Trying out dotnet development under Linux and getting a feel for it
